                <h1>App Overview</h1>
                <p>This DM's Grimoire is intended to support a Dungeon Master (or DM) in running a campaign for their players. It contains an encyclopedia of monsters, items and spells for the DM's reference and also holds their players' information and allows changes, in-app. The DM's Grimoire also provides a die rolling suite that supports rolling multiple dice at once and can calculate advantaged and disadvantaged rolls.</p>

                <h2>Dice Roller</h2>
                <p>The dice roller allows the DM to roll each of the six types of dice commonly used in Dungeons and Dragons. The rolls can consist of any number of type of die, but not a mixture of different types. For example, a DM can roll 12d6 at the same time; but they cannot roll 1d6 and 1d8 at the same time. When rolling a d20, a DM can use the advantage and disadvantage buttons to roll 2d20 and keep the highest or lowest, respectively.</p>
                <p>The result breakdown displays each of the results of a multi-die roll, separating them with a comma. It will also display each of the results from an advantaged or disadvantaged roll.</p>
