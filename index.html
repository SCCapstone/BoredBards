                <h1>App Overview</h1>
                <p>This DM's Grimoire is intended to support a Dungeon Master (or DM) in running a campaign for their players. It contains an encyclopedia of monsters, items and spells for the DM's reference and also holds their players' information and allows changes, in-app. The DM's Grimoire also provides a die rolling suite that supports rolling multiple dice at once and can calculate advantaged and disadvantaged rolls.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="howTo">
                <h1>Details</h1>
                <p>The DM's Grimoire opens on the login page, which supports Google Account synchronization or raw account creation. Once a user is logged in, they can access their campaigns and players, the dice roller, their notes and the settings page. Each of these is contained on a separate screen and can be accessed from the nav-bar at the bottom of each page.</p>
                <h3>Campaigns</h3>
                <p>The campaigns page allows a user to create, maintain and delete their campaigns. They can add or remove players and attach notes to each campaign.</p>
                <!--Add the image source for campaigns screenshot-->

                <h3>Dice Roller</h3>
                <p>The dice roller allows the DM to roll each of the six types of dice commonly used in Dungeons and Dragons. The rolls can consist of any number of type of die, but not a mixture of different types. For example, a DM can roll 12d6 at the same time; but they cannot roll 1d6 and 1d8 at the same time. When rolling a d20, a DM can use the advantage and disadvantage buttons to roll 2d20 and keep the highest or lowest, respectively.</p>
                <p>The result breakdown displays each of the results of a multi-die roll, separating them with a comma. It will also display each of the results from an advantaged or disadvantaged roll.</p>

                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <p>The notes page allows a DM to record important notes and events from their campaign and keep them in a list, sorted by date of creation. Notes can be deleted and modified after creation.</p>
                <p>At the botom of the page, there is a button for adding a new note.</p>
                <img src="" alt="The notes page. At the bottom, a button labeled 'Add Note'.">
                <p>After clicking the 'Add Note' button, the user is taken to a page for entering the note's title and contents. After the note is filled with the intend information, the user clicks the 'Create Note' button.</p>
                <img src="" alt="The note creation page. Here, a user enters the note's title and contents.">
                <p>Upon clicking a specific, existing note, the user can see the note's details. These include the title, contents and date of creation.</p>
                <img src="" alt="The note detail page. This page displays the note's title, its contents and its date of creation.">

                <h3>Settings</h3>
                <p>The settings page is the user's place to logout, report an issue or get information about the project. There are three options listed on this page.
